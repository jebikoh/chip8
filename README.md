# Chip8 Emulator

A quick Chip8 emulator. This is my first project in Rust.

References I used:
 - [Write A Chip8 Emulator](https://tobiasvl.github.io/blog/write-a-chip-8-emulator/)
 - [Chip8 Book](https://github.com/aquova/chip8-book): only used as reference after writing myself (for correctness :))
